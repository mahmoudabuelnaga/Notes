# Spring Boot Initialzr Demo

## Spring Initializr:
1. Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to quickly generate a Spring project skeleton.
2. Choose the required dependencies for your project.
3. Generate the project as a Maven or Gradle build.
4. Import the generated project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans.

## Quick word on Maven:
1. Your Java project may require additional JAR files, such as Spring, Hibernate, Commons Logging, JSON, etc.
2. One method to obtain these JAR files is by downloading them directly from the respective project websites.
3. After obtaining the JAR files, you need to manually add them to your project's build path or classpath.

## Maven Solution:
- Maven is used to manage project dependencies, such as Spring and Hibernate.
- It automatically downloads the necessary JAR files for the dependencies specified.
- Maven makes these JAR files accessible during both compile time and runtime.
- Maven acts as a "personal shopper" for your project, handling dependency management.
- The course will cover Maven basics initially, with more detailed information provided later.

## Development process:
1. Configure our project at the Spring Initializr website, [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
2. Download the zip file
3. Unzip the file
4. Import the project into our IDE.
