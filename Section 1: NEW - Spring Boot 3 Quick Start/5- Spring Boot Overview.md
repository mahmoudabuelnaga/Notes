# Spring Boot Overview
### Spring in a nutshell:
Spring is a popular Java application framework with many helper classes and annotations.

---
### The problem:
Spring application setup is challenging due to dependency, configuration, and server installation questions.

---
### Spring Boot solution:
Spring Boot simplifies Spring setup, automates configuration, resolves dependencies, and includes an embedded HTTP server for quick starts.

---
### what's the relationship between Spring Boot and Spring?
Spring Boot simplifies using Spring.

---
### Spring initializer:
Spring Boot's Spring Initializer: Quickly generate Maven/Gradle Spring projects with selected dependencies via [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/), for easy IDE import (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc.).

###  Spring Boot embedded Server:

Spring Boot embeds HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow directly in your application JAR, enabling a self-contained, standalone application without needing a separate server installation.

### Running Spring Boot Apps:

Spring Boot app deployment: standalone with embedded server; runnable via IDE, command line, or with `java -jar mycoolapp.jar`.

### Deploying Spring Boot Apps:

1. Spring Boot applications can be deployed traditionally by packaging them as WAR files.
2. These WAR files can then be deployed to external servers such as Tomcat, JBoss, or WebSphere.
3. There's no need for an embedded server within the Spring Boot app when deploying as a WAR file since the external server handles the application runtime.
4. The deployment process involves taking the Spring Boot application, packaged as a WAR file, and deploying it to an already installed and running server on a corporate network.
5. This method allows for multiple teams to deploy their applications traditionally on the same server, supporting a variety of projects like travel, e-commerce, etc.

### Spring Boot FAQ

**#1 Does Spring Boot replace Spring MVC, Spring REST, et cetera?**
![alt text](<Images/Screenshot from 2024-02-04 15-11-52.png>)
The answer is No, because:
- Spring Boot complements Spring technologies (Core, AOP, MVC, REST).
- It simplifies configuration and setup processes.
- Enables quick project setup with minimal effort.
- It does not compete with, but enhances Spring ecosystem functionalities.

**#2 And the next question I get a lot is, you know does the Spring Boot code run faster than regular Spring code?**
The answer's No because Spring Boot simplifies setup with minimal config, using underlying Spring framework code.

**#3 And then the other question I get a lot is do I need a special IDE for Spring Boot?**
The answer is No. Use any IDE or text editor for Spring Boot; STS and IDE plugins available but not required. Choose what suits you, including Maven and command line.
