# Spring Boot Starter
## The Problem:
Building the Spring Application is very Hard.

## Why is it so Hard?
- It would be great if there was a simple list of Maven Debendences.
- Collected as a group of dependences ... one-step shop.
- So I don't have to search for each debendency

## The Solution - Spring Boot Starter:
- Spring Boot Starters.
- A curated list of Maven debendencies.
- A collection of debendencies grouped together.
- Testing and Verified by the Spring Development Team.
- Makes it much easier for the developer to get started with Spring.
- Reduces the amount of Maven configuration.
