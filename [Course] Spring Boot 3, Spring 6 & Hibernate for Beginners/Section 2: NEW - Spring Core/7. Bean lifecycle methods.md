# Bean lifecycle methods
Spring Framework provides a robust model for managing the lifecycle of beans within its container. Understanding the lifecycle is crucial for leveraging Spring's powerful features like dependency injection and AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming). This document outlines the key lifecycle methods/hooks that Spring beans go through from initialization to destruction.

### 1. Bean Definition

The lifecycle begins with the definition of a bean in the Spring configuration file. This definition specifies the bean's class, its properties, and other configuration settings.

### 2. Bean Instantiation

Spring container instantiates the bean from its class definition. If the bean is a singleton (the default scope), it will be created only once; otherwise, it will be created anew each time it is needed.

### 3. Populating Properties

After instantiation, Spring injects values into the bean's properties using dependency injection. This can be done via constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.

### 4. BeanNameAware Interface

If the bean implements the `BeanNameAware` interface, Spring passes the bean's ID to the `setBeanName` method.

### 5. BeanFactoryAware and ApplicationContextAware

If the bean implements `BeanFactoryAware` or `ApplicationContextAware`, Spring passes the `BeanFactory` or `ApplicationContext` instance to it, respectively. This allows the bean to interact with the Spring container directly.

### 6. PreInitialization - BeanPostProcessors

Before the bean is initialized, Spring allows `BeanPostProcessor` implementations to perform custom operations. `postProcessBeforeInitialization` method is called at this stage.

### 7. InitializingBean and Custom init-method

If the bean implements `InitializingBean`, its `afterPropertiesSet` method is called. Additionally, if the bean's definition includes an `init-method`, it is also called. These methods can be used for custom initialization logic.

### 8. PostInitialization - BeanPostProcessors

After the bean is initialized, Spring allows `BeanPostProcessor` implementations to perform further operations. `postProcessAfterInitialization` method is called at this stage.

### 9. Bean Is Ready for Use

At this point, the bean is fully initialized and ready for use within the application.

### 10. DisposableBean and Custom destroy-method

As the application shuts down, if the bean implements `DisposableBean`, its `destroy` method is called. Additionally, if the bean's definition includes a `destroy-method`, it is also called. These methods can be used for cleanup activities.

### 11. Shutdown Hook

Optionally, a shutdown hook can be registered to ensure that the Spring context closes gracefully when the JVM shuts down.

Understanding these lifecycle hooks allows developers to hook into the bean lifecycle for custom behavior, ensuring that resources are managed efficiently and the application behaves as expected.

- The @PostConstruct annotation approach is part of the standard Java EE and is generally preferred over the XML configuration for its simplicity and adherence to the convention over configuration principle.
- Make sure that your initialization method does not throw any checked exceptions unless you handle them within the method itself, as this could prevent the bean from being created properly.
- Spring also supports a destruction callback via the destroy-method attribute in XML or the @PreDestroy annotation, which you can use to clean up resources when the bean is about to be destroyed.
