# Lazy Initialization
## Initialization:
- By default, when your application starts, all beans are initialized like `@Component`, etc ...
- Spring will create an instance of each and make them available.

- By default, when your application starts, all beans are initialized.
- Spring will create an instance of each and make them available. 

## Lazy Initialization:
- Instead of creating all beans up front, we can specify lazy initialization.
- A bean will only be initialized in the following cases:
    - It is needed for dependency injection.
    - Or it is explicitly.
- Add the @Lazy annotation to a given class.
    - Bean is only initialized if needed for dependency injection.
    - Sence we are NOT injecting class .. it is not initialized.
- To configure other beans for lazy initializtion:
    - We would need to add `@Lazy` to each class.
- Turns into tedious work for a large number of classes.
- I wish we could set a global configuration property into application.property file:
    - `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true`
    - All beans are lazy ... no beans are created until needed or including our DemoController
        - Once we access REST endpoint /dailyworkout
        - Spring will determine dependencies for DemoController...
    - For dependency resolution:
        - Spring creates instance of CricketCoach first ...
        - Then creates instance of DemoController and injects the CricketCoach.


### Advantages

#### 1. **Reduced Startup Time**
- **Description**: By deferring the instantiation of beans until they are needed, lazy initialization can significantly reduce the startup time of an application.
- **Impact**: This is particularly beneficial for large applications with many components, as it allows for a faster launch and availability to users.

#### 2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**
- **Description**: Only the beans that are required are created, which means that resources are not wasted on initializing unused components.
- **Impact**: This leads to more efficient use of memory and other system resources, which can be crucial in resource-constrained environments.

#### 3. **Improved Performance in Development**
- **Description**: During development, developers often work on a specific part of the application. Lazy initialization ensures that only the relevant parts of the application are loaded.
- **Impact**: This can speed up the development and testing cycles, making the development process more efficient.

### Disadvantages

#### 1. **Increased Latency on First Access**
- **Description**: The first time a bean is requested, it must be instantiated, which can introduce a noticeable delay, especially if the bean has complex initialization logic or depends on other lazily initialized beans.
- **Impact**: This can negatively affect the performance perception of end-users, particularly for operations that are time-sensitive.

#### 2. **Complexity in Error Handling**
- **Description**: Errors related to bean creation or dependency injection that would normally be caught at startup may only surface when the bean is first accessed.
- **Impact**: This can make debugging more challenging, as issues may only manifest under specific conditions that trigger the bean's instantiation.

#### 3. **Difficulties in Performance Monitoring**
- **Description**: The deferred nature of bean instantiation can make it more challenging to monitor the application's performance and identify bottlenecks.
- **Impact**: Administrators and developers may find it harder to optimize the applicationâ€™s resource use and response times, as the initialization load is spread out and less predictable.

### Conclusion

Lazy initialization in Spring can offer significant advantages in terms of startup time and resource efficiency, making it an attractive option for many applications. However, the potential for increased latency, along with challenges in error handling and performance monitoring, necessitates careful consideration. Decisions on using lazy initialization should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of the application, as well as the overall impact on user experience and system resources.
