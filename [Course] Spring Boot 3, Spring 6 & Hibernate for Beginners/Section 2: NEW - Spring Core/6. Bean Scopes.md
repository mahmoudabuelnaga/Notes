# Understanding Bean Scopes in Spring Framework

## Introduction

In the Spring Framework, beans are the foundational building blocks of any Spring application. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. One of the key concepts in managing beans in Spring is the notion of bean scopes. Bean scopes determine the lifecycle and visibility of a bean within the application context.

## Bean Scopes Overview

Spring provides several scopes for beans, each serving different purposes and having different lifecycles. Here is an overview of the available bean scopes:

### 1. **Singleton**
- **Description**: The default scope. Ensures a single instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire container. Any request for this bean will return the same instance and it is cashed in memory.![alt text](<Images/Screenshot from 2024-02-28 17-26-59.png>)
- **Use Case**: Ideal for stateless beans where the same instance can be used across the application.![alt text](<Images/Screenshot from 2024-02-28 17-26-02.png>)![alt text](<Images/Screenshot from 2024-02-28 17-41-42.png>)
- Example:
    ```java
    @Component
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public class SingletonBean {
    }
    ```

### 2. **Prototype**
- **Description**: Creates a new instance of the bean each time it is requested from the container. This scope is useful when each consumer needs a distinct instance of a bean.

- **Use Case**: Suitable for beans that are stateful and unique to each request or operation.

- Example:
    ```java
    @Component
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) 
    // or
    @Scope("prototype")
    public class PrototypeBean {
    }
    ```

### 3. **Request**
- **Description**: Creates a bean instance for each HTTP request. This scope is only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
- **Use Case**: Useful for web applications where bean state should be scoped to an individual HTTP request.
- Example:
    ```java
    @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
    @Component
    public class RequestBean {
    }
    ```

### 4. **Session**
- **Description**: Creates a bean instance for an HTTP session. Like the request scope, it is specific to web applications.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for storing user-specific data that should persist across multiple requests within the same session.
- Example:
    ```java
    @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
    @Component
    public class SessionBean {
    }
    ```

### 5. **Application**
- **Description**: Scopes a bean definition to the lifecycle of a `ServletContext`. Only one instance of the bean is created for the entire web application running in a single `ServletContext`.
- **Use Case**: Useful for application-wide resources like configuration settings.
- Example:
    ```java
    @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_APPLICATION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
    @Component
    public class ApplicationBean {
    }
    ```

### 6. **Websocket**
- **Description**: Scopes a bean definition to the lifecycle of a WebSocket. It's specific to applications using WebSocket connections.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for managing data within the lifecycle of a WebSocket session.
- Example:
    ```java
    @Scope(value = "websocket", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
    @Component
    public class WebSocketBean {
    }
    ```

## Selecting the Appropriate Scope

Choosing the right bean scope depends on the specific use case of the bean within your application. Consider the following when selecting a scope:

- **Singleton**: Use for shared, stateless services or repositories.
- **Prototype**: Use when each consumer requires a unique instance.
- **Request, Session, Application**: Use in web applications where you need to maintain state across HTTP requests, sessions, or the entire application.
- **Websocket**: Use in applications that require maintaining state within a WebSocket session.

## Conclusion

Understanding and correctly utilizing bean scopes is crucial for effectively managing the lifecycle of beans in your Spring applications. Each scope serves a specific purpose and choosing the right scope can enhance the performance and scalability of your application. Always consider the scope that best fits the beanâ€™s intended use case within your application architecture.
