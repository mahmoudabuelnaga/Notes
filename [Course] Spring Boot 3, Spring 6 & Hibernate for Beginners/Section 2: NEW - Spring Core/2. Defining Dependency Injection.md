# Defining Dependency Injection
## Dependency Injection
- The Dependency inversion principle.
- The client delegates to another object the responsibility of providing its dependencies.

## Injection Types:
- There are multiple of injection with spring.
- We will cover the two recommended types of injection:

### Constructor Injection:
- Use this when you have required dependency.
- Generally recommended by the spring.io development team as first chioce.

### Setter Injection: 
- Use this when you have optional dependencies.
- If dependency is not provided, your app can provide reasonable default logic.

## What is Spring AutoWiring?
- For dependency injection, Spring can use autowiring.
- Spring will lock for a class that matches by type: `class` or `interface`
- Spring will inject it automatically ... hence it is autowired

## Spring Boot Application Annotation

### Overview

In the Spring Boot framework, the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

- `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
- `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the pre-defined package, allowing it to find and register all the beans automatically.

### Usage

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is typically used on the main application class. Here is an example of how it can be applied:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This simple annotation enables a host of Spring Boot’s auto-configuration features and acts as an entry point for launching an application.

### Customization

While `@SpringBootApplication` is a powerful tool for rapid development, there may be cases where the default behavior needs to be customized:

#### Excluding Specific Auto-Configuration Classes

You can exclude specific auto-configuration classes by using the `exclude` attribute:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyApplication {
    // ...
}
```

#### Customizing Component Scanning

By default, `@SpringBootApplication` scans the package of the annotated class and its sub-packages. To scan different or additional packages, use the `scanBasePackages` attribute:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"com.myapp.services", "com.myapp.controllers"})
public class MyApplication {
    // ...
}
```

#### Advanced Configuration

For more advanced configurations, you can use the `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations separately. This allows for more granular control over the application context and its behavior.

### Conclusion

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a key component of Spring Boot applications, simplifying configuration and deployment. By understanding how to use and customize this annotation, developers can take full advantage of Spring Boot’s capabilities to create efficient, robust applications.
