When configuring Spring beans using Java configuration, you use a class annotated with `@Configuration` to define your beans. This approach provides a type-safe way to configure your beans and their dependencies. Below is a guide on how to format and organize a Java configuration class for Spring beans.

### Step 1: Annotate Class with `@Configuration`

The class that defines beans should be annotated with `@Configuration` to indicate that it provides Spring configuration. This class can contain methods annotated with `@Bean`, each of which will define a bean to be managed by the Spring container.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    // Bean definitions will go here
}
```

### Step 2: Define Beans Using `@Bean` Annotation

Within the configuration class, define methods to instantiate and configure your beans. Each method should be annotated with `@Bean`. The method name usually serves as the bean name within the Spring application context, and the method should return an instance of the bean.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Inject Dependencies

For beans that have dependencies on other beans, you can inject these dependencies through method parameters in the `@Bean` methods. Spring takes care of providing the required beans by looking at the available beans in the application context.

```java
@Bean
public MyService myService(MyRepository myRepository) {
    return new MyService(myRepository);
}
```

### Step 4: Use `@PostConstruct` for Initialization Logic

For any initialization logic that needs to run after the bean's properties have been set, use the `@PostConstruct` annotation on a method within the bean class.

```java
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;

public class MyBean {

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        // Initialization logic here
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Configuration Profiles

If you need different configurations for different environments, you can use `@Profile` annotation to specify which beans should be included in which environment.

```java
@Bean
@Profile("development")
public DataSource dataSource() {
    // Returns a DataSource for development environment
}
```

### Step 6: Externalizing Configuration

Use `@PropertySource` to externalize your configuration to a properties file, and `@Value` to inject property values into your beans.

```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:app.properties")
public class AppConfig {

    @Value("${my.property}")
    private String myProperty;

    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        MyBean myBean = new MyBean();
        myBean.setProperty(myProperty);
        return myBean;
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Keep Configuration Modular**: Organize your configuration into logical units. Use `@Import` to include configurations from other classes when necessary.
- **Use Constructor Injection**: Whenever possible, use constructor injection to ensure that required dependencies are not null.
- **Prefer Java Configuration Over XML**: Java configuration is more type-safe and integrates better with modern Java development tools and practices.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively manage and organize your Spring beans using Java configuration. This approach provides a clear and concise way to configure your Spring application context, making it easier to understand and maintain.
